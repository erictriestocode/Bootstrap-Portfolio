# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This repo is for our second homework assignment, in which we recreate our personal portfolio with bootstrap.

Also using this as a test for www.gitpod.io(pretty neat!)

Bootstrap was a little confusing at first, thankfully Will clarified a lot in class as to its use; that helped a lot and I feel a lot better about how to use it effectively.

Expect some commits after the due date time as I continue to work on this.
